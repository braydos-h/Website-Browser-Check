# website-os-checker

This project contains a single HTML page that lists device information that your browser can access. Open `index.html` in a modern browser and it will display details such as:

- User agent and platform
- Available languages
- CPU count and memory (if available)
- Screen resolution and color depth
- Network connection information
- Time zone
- Optional geolocation and media devices (may prompt for permission)

Everything runs in the browserâ€”no network requests are required.
